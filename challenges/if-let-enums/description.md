Enums in Rust are a powerful way to define a type that can hold one of several distinct variants. Often, you may want to perform an operation only for specific variants of an enum. The `if let` construct provides a concise way to handle such situations, avoiding the verbosity of a full `match` expression when only one pattern needs to be matched.

In this challenge, you will use `if let` to extract and operate on specific variants of an enum.

## Your Task

Your task is to implement a function `process_message` that takes an enum `Message` as input. The `Message` enum has the following variants:

- `Text(String)`: Represents a textual message.
- `Number(i32)`: Represents a numerical message.
- `Quit`: Represents a command to quit.
- `None`: Represents no message.

The function should:

1. Return `"Processed Text: <content>"` for a `Text` variant, replacing `<content>` with the actual string.
2. Return `"Processed Number: <value>"` for a `Number` variant, replacing `<value>` with the actual number.
3. Return `"Quit Command Received"` for the `Quit` variant.
4. Return `"No Message"` for the `None` variant.

Use `if let` wherever possible to implement the function.

### Example

```rust
assert_eq!(process_message(Message::Text(String::from("Hello"))), "Processed Text: Hello");
assert_eq!(process_message(Message::Number(42)), "Processed Number: 42");
assert_eq!(process_message(Message::Quit), "Quit Command Received");
assert_eq!(process_message(Message::None), "No Message");
```

## Hints

- You can use the `if let` construct like this:
  ```rust
  if let EnumVariant(value) = enum_instance {
      // Perform actions with `value`.
  }
  ```
- For other variants, you can use `else` after `if let`.
- Remember to handle all variants in the enum for this task.
