Enums can be useful to compare different states of a type, for example `if status == OrderStatus::Pending`. However, you can not directly compare two enums for equality.

For this to work, you need to implement the `PartialEq` trait for the enum.

This can be done manually, but Rust provides a convenient way to implement the `PartialEq` trait for types using the `derive` attribute. This allows you to compare instances of a type for equality without manually implementing the trait.

In this challenge, you'll define a simple enum and use `#[derive(PartialEq)]` to automatically implement equality checks.

## Your Task

1. Define an enum `OrderStatus` with the following variants:

   - `Pending` — a unit variant representing an order that is not yet processed.
   - `Shipped` — a unit variant representing an order that has been shipped.
   - `Cancelled(String)` — a tuple variant with a reason for cancellation.

2. Use the `#[derive(PartialEq)]` attribute to derive the `PartialEq` trait for the enum.

3. Write tests to ensure that the derived implementation works as expected.

### Example

```rust

```

### Requirements

1. Use the `#[derive(PartialEq)]` macro for the `OrderStatus` enum.
2. Write tests to verify the equality and inequality of the enum variants.

- Use the `derive` macro on the enum to automatically implement `PartialEq`.
- String types in Rust already implement `PartialEq`, so `Cancelled(String)` can be compared automatically.
