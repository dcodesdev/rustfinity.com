Generics in Rust allow you to write code that works with different types without duplicating code for each specific type. They are commonly used in functions, structs, enums, and methods to make your code more reusable and flexible.

For this challenge, you will implement a generic struct `ItemContainer` that can store any type of item and provide methods to retrieve and manipulate the item.

## Your Task

1. Define a generic struct `ItemContainer<T>` with a single field `item: T`.
2. Implement a method `get_item` that returns a reference to the item.

## Hints
