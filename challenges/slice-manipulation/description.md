Now that you have an overview of slices, let's make it a little bit more challenging. In this problem, you will implement a function that updates specific elements of a mutable slice.

## Your Task

Write a function `update_slice(slice: &mut [i32], indices: &[usize], value: i32)` that updates specific elements of a mutable slice. The function should:

1. Take a mutable slice of integers (`slice`) as the first argument.
2. Take a slice of indices (`indices`) that specify which elements of the mutable slice to update.
3. Update each specified index in the slice to the given `value`.

The function should handle the following:

- If an index in `indices` is out of bounds for the `slice`, the function should skip it without causing a panic.
- Modify only the elements specified by valid indices.
- Ensure that out-of-bound indices in the `indices` slice do not cause runtime errors.
- Remember that slices are views into arrays or vectors; they cannot be resized, but their contents can be modified.

## How it Works

```rust
let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
update_slice(&mut data, &[1, 3, 4], 7);
assert_eq!(data, vec![1, 7, 3, 7, 7]);

let mut data = vec![10, 20, 30];
update_slice(&mut data, &[2, 5], 100); // Index 5 is out of bounds
assert_eq!(data, vec![10, 20, 100]);
```

## Hints

If you're having trouble, consider these hints:

- Use the `.get_mut(index)` method to safely access a mutable reference to an element at a given index. This avoids panics for out-of-bound accesses.
- A `for` loop is useful for iterating through the `indices` slice.
