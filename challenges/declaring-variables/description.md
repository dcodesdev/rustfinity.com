In this challenge, you will implement a function `calculate_area` that computes the area of a rectangle using a given `width` and `height`. The purpose of this exercise is to practice variable declaration.

## Your Task

You are provided with a helper function `prints_values` that takes two parameters, `width` and `height`, and prints their values. Your task is to call this helper function inside `calculate_area` and ensure that the printed values are correct.

The `calculate_area` function should:

1. Declare variables for `width` and `height`.
2. Use the `prints_values` function to display the values of the `width` and `height`.
3. Return the calculated area of the rectangle by multiplying `width` and `height`.

Do not modify the `prints_values` function.

> **Note:** While it is possible to solve the challenge and pass the tests without explicitly declaring variables (e.g., by directly passing values to `prints_values` or using expressions inline), we recommend you practice declaring variables using the `let` keyword.

## Hints

- Use the `let` keyword to declare variables in Rust.
- Ensure the `prints_values` function is invoked with the correct arguments.
- The returned area should be the result of multiplying the `width` and `height`.
