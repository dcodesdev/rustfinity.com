Sometimes, you need to perform an operation that might fail, such as reading a file or performing other I/O tasks. Rust’s `Result<T, E>` allows you to handle success and failure explicitly, but there are cases where you don’t need to distinguish between different kinds of errors. Instead, you can treat any failure as a `None`.

In this challenge, you will write a function that performs an I/O operation, handles the result, and converts it into an `Option`.

## Your Task

Implement the function `read_first_line_as_option`:

1. It takes a file path (`&str`) as input.
2. Attempts to open the file and read its first line.
3. If the operation is successful, return `Some(String)` containing the first line.
4. If any error occurs (e.g., the file doesn’t exist, or the line cannot be read), return `None`.

### Requirements

- Use `std::fs::File` and `std::io::{self, BufRead}` to read the file.
- Propagate errors from the file operation using `?`.
- Convert the `Result` into an `Option` to handle errors.

## Hints

If you're stuck, here are some hints to help you solve the challenge:

- Use `std::fs::File::open` to open a file, and handle errors with `?`.
- Use `io::BufReader::new` to wrap the file for line-by-line reading.
- Use the `ok()` method on a `Result` to convert it into an `Option`.
