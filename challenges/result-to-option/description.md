Sometimes you run some operation that might fail inside a function that returns an `Option<T>` and you don't care about the error details. You can simply convert the `Result<T, E>` into an `Option<T>` and handle the error as `None`.

You can easily convert between `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` using the `ok()` method on `Result`. This method returns `Some(T)` if the `Result` is `Ok(T)`, and `None` if the `Result` is `Err(E)`.

## Your Task

In this challenge, you will write a function that performs an I/O operation, handles the result, and converts it into an `Option`.

Implement the function `read_first_line_as_option`:

1. It takes a file path (`&str`) as input.
2. Attempts to open the file and read its first line.
3. If the operation is successful, return `Some(String)` containing the first line.
4. If any error occurs (e.g., the file doesnâ€™t exist, or the line cannot be read), return `None`.

### Requirements

- Use `std::fs::File` and `std::io::{self, BufRead}` to read the file.
- Propagate errors from the file operation using `?`.
- Convert the `Result` into an `Option` to handle errors.

## Hints

If you're stuck, here are some hints to help you solve the challenge:

- Use `std::fs::File::open` to open a file, and handle errors with `?`.
- Use `io::BufReader::new` to wrap the file for line-by-line reading.
- Use the `ok()` method on a `Result` to convert it into an `Option`.
