In Rust, traits are a powerful tool for creating abstractions. When combined with trait objects, they allow for dynamic polymorphism, making them ideal for designing extensible systems like plugin architectures. In this challenge, you will create a plugin system that dynamically loads and executes plugins at runtime.

A plugin in this system is any type that implements a specific trait. Each plugin will perform a specific task, and the system should manage a collection of these plugins, executing them in sequence. Youâ€™ll also address advanced issues like object safety and resolving potential conflicts between overlapping trait implementations.

## Your Task

Design and implement a plugin system using trait objects. You will:

1. Define a `Plugin` trait that includes methods for initialization and execution.
2. Create a `PluginManager` struct to manage plugins. It should:
   - Dynamically load plugins implementing the `Plugin` trait.
   - Allow adding and removing plugins.
   - Execute all registered plugins in sequence.
3. Address object safety to ensure the system works correctly with trait objects.

### Requirements

- The `Plugin` trait should include the following methods:
  - `fn name(&self) -> &str;` - Returns the name of the plugin.
  - `fn execute(&self);` - Executes the plugin's functionality.
- The `PluginManager` should:
  - Use dynamic dispatch to store and manage plugins.
  - Provide methods to add, remove, and list plugins.
  - Execute all registered plugins using their `execute` method.
- Ensure that the `Plugin` trait is object-safe.
- Use appropriate error handling for cases like duplicate plugin names.

## Hints

- **Object Safety**: Remember that traits used with trait objects must be object-safe. This means no methods with generic parameters or `Self` in non-where clause positions.
- **Dynamic Dispatch**: Store plugins in a `Vec<Box<dyn Plugin>>` for dynamic dispatch.
- **Plugin Uniqueness**: Use the `name` method to identify and ensure uniqueness among plugins.
- **Iterators**: Leverage iterators to execute plugins in sequence or to filter them by specific criteria.
