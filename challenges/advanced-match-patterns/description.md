Rust's `match` statement is one of the most powerful tools for control flow, enabling developers to destructure and analyze complex data types efficiently. This challenge will push your knowledge of `match` to the limit by requiring you to handle nested enums, structs, and tuple types with detailed patterns.

You are given a deeply nested data structure that combines enums, structs, and tuples. Your task is to use `match` to destructure this data and return specific information based on its content. This requires a thorough understanding of Rust's pattern matching syntax, including `@` bindings, guards, and wildcard patterns.

### Your Task

Create a function `analyze_data` that takes a `Data` enum and returns a `String` describing its content. The function must:

1. Match all possible variants of the enum.
2. Destructure the nested data as deeply as necessary.
3. Use guards to handle specific edge cases.
4. Provide meaningful outputs for all cases.

### Requirements

- You must use a `match` statement to handle the data.
- Ensure that all enum variants and nested data are covered in the pattern matching.
- Use guards and bindings for additional conditions where necessary.
- The function must not panic for any input.

### Hints

- Use `@` bindings to capture values while matching specific patterns.
- Remember to use `_` as a wildcard for unused or irrelevant values.
- You can use guards (`if` conditions) within patterns to add extra matching logic.
- Pay attention to the order of match arms, as they are evaluated from top to bottom.
- The `Some` and `None` variants of `Option` and nested structs can be destructured directly in match arms.
